# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Page Routing
### Pages Folder
- Right click the pages folder and press new folder and name it the name of the page. In that folder create two files: Name.js and Name.css where Name is the name of the page as well.
- Next go to the index.js file and copy what the previous lines have but change the names to the name of you folder.
### App.js
- In this file, you will see where the imports are and that the page names are there in one line. Add the new page name.
-Lower in the app you will see routes. Copy and paste the home one and change the word Home with the name of your file and same with the file path so it should be '/pagename' and <PageName/>.
- Now when you create buttons to other pages there will be no issue cause we have a route.
### Navigate with button
- In the page you have your buttons do this at the top with the other imports:
import { use Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'

-Then before the return inside the big function create this function:

const navigate - useNavigate();

-Now create a button like normal and add the onclick function with the navigate function:

<button onClick={() => navigate('/pagename')}>Next Page</button>

- This means when you click it goes to that page. And now you're all set!
